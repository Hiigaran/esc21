title: Floating-Point Representation

Compile the example float-rep.c

       gcc float-rep.c -o float-rep

Run the executable ./float-rep and enter a number, its single-precision floating-point representation (as stored in memory) will be shown to you, next to the number which it actually represent.

Compile the example float-distance.c

       g++ float-distance.cpp -o float-distance

Run the executable ./float-distance 

This is showing to you the number of representable double precision floating-point values in an interval.

1. Is this the same for intervals of the same "size"?
2. Try to let it show you other intervals; some of the interesting ones are commented in the source code.
